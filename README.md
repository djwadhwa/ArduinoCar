ArduinoCar

The car uses an Arduino Uno that can be controlled via a Universal remote and needs to be directed toward the IR sensor. Additionally, RGB led strips and a bulb were provided by Adafruit, which are used for aesthetic purposes. 

The Car is built to compete againts robots in racing competitions on tracks and in mazes. 

This bot was built over a period of 1 week and developed using the Arduino IDE and the C language.

The universal remote used is a Sony RM-VZ220 and controls the robots movement, led colors, and audio (associated with movement).
